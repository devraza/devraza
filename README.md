# Devraza

I'm a moderately skilled programmer, beginner in the field of cybersecurity and aspiring graphic designer.
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is my operating system of choice, and [radiant.nvim](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/radiant.nvim) (my bespoke distribution of [neovim](https://neovim.io)) is my text editor.

I also happen to be a devoted rustacean and a devout follower of the self-hosted way of life.

My skills in programming language I've used so far are as follows:
- Advanced: `Python`, `Nix`
- Intermediate: `Rust`, `Go`, `E-Lisp`
- Beginner: `Julia`, `Lua`

However, I consider myself able to work to a reasonable degree with any modern programming language.

Other *tools* that I can work with include `git`, `linux`, `inkscape`, and `GIMP`.

You can find my website [here](https://devraza.giize.com), where I make blog posts and showcase my projects.
