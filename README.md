# Devraza

I'm a moderately skilled programmer and beginner in cybersecurity.
[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is my operating system of choice, and [neovim](https://neovim.org) is my text editor.

I also happen to be a devoted rustacean and a follower of the self-hosted way of life.

Programming language skills:
- Advanced: `Python`
- Intermediate: `Rust`, `Go`, `Nix`, `E-Lisp`
- Beginner: `Julia`, `Lua`

Other things I can also work with include `git`, `linux`, `inkscape`, and `GIMP`.

You can find my website [here](https://devraza.duckdns.org), where I make blog posts and showcase my projects.
