Note: I've decided to move to a more sustainable scheme of working. This includes things such as my website and e-mail. Will post any changes to my workflow.

** What do I do?
I do a lot of work within open-source software: doing my fair share of contributions, no matter how small and working with popular projects such as [[https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea][charmbracelet's bubbletea]], [[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][NeoVim]], and a few others.

** Programming Languages
I'm a huge fan of the following languages, and can *half-truthfully* say I know them very well:
+ E-Lisp
+ Rust
+ Lua
+ Go

** Socials?
You can contact me at any time at my email address: ~devraza@outlook.com~
