** What do I do?
I'm a *huge* fan of open-source software, in particular, Linux, Rust, and Bubbletea
I like to work with [[https://github.com/devraza/fate][Fate]] (my Doom Emacs configuration), [[https://voidlinux.org][Void GNU/Linux]], and [[https://github.com/devraza/aweful][Aweful]] (my AwesomeWM configuration).

** Languages I use
I'm a huge fan of the following languages, and can half-truthfully say I know them very well:
+ E-Lisp
+ Rust
+ Lua
+ Go
