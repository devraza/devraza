** What do I do?
I'm a *huge* fan of open-source software, in particular, Linux, Rust, and Bubbletea
I like to work with [[https://github.com/devraza/dianciemacs][dianciemacs]] (my very own minimal and elegant  Emacs configuration framework), [[https://archlinux.org][Arch GNU/Linux]], and [[https://hyprland.org][Hyprland]].

** Languages I use
I'm a huge fan of the following languages, and can half-truthfully say I know them very well:
+ E-Lisp
+ Rust
+ Lua
+ Go

** Socials?
You can contact me at any time at my email address: ~devraza@outlook.com~
